# Astronauts

This is the repository where we created a node.js app to consume an API which shows current list of astronauts in space.

## Steps to recreate package by yourself

Create the directory and init the node package, then create the server

``` bash
$ mkdir astronauts
$ npm init -y
$ touch server.js
```
